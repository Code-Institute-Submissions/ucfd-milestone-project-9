# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. 


## Overview

I decided to use this milestone project as an opportunity to create a website which comprises of a home page, which conveys a small bio section, work experience and qualifications and two seperate pages to showcase my own personal art and games that I have developed. 

I hope to make more contributions to this project after offically submitting it as I feel it would be a useful aside while contnuing the progress through the course, I can then apply new techniques and update the site to practice and use the information I have gained through the learning process. 

-------------------------------------------------

## UX

as the subject of the project is myself and my portfolio of work, my primary demographic will be potential future employers/clients but also the site will cater for users with a general interest in the content. 




Wireframes, or more what could be more accurately described as high resolution mock-ups, can be found in the 'Wireframes' folder within this project. 

-------------------------------------------------

## FEATURES 

### EXISTING FEATURES 

* Simplistic navigation, fixed to top of page with a light, translucent background for ease of use.




### FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT 

* Working games to game page using PhaserJS. 
* More content on the home page, i.e downloadable CV with icon

* Transitions and animation of certain elements
