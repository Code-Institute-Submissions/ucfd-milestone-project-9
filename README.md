User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. 

-------------------------------------------------

I decided to use this milestone project as an opportunity to create a website which comprises of a home page, which conveys a small bio section, work experience and qualifications and two seperate pages to showcase my own personal art and games that I have developed. 

I hope to make more contributions to this project after offically submitting it as I feel it would be a useful aside while contnuing the progress through the course, I can then apply new techniques and update the site to practice and use the information I have gained through the learning process.

UX

as the subject of the project is myself and my portfolio of work, my primary demographic will be potential future employers/clients but lso the site will cater for users with a general interest in the content.
