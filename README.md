# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. 


## Overview

I decided to use this milestone project as an opportunity to create a website which comprises of a home page, which conveys a small bio section, work experience and qualifications and two seperate pages to showcase my own personal art and games that I have developed. 

I hope to make more contributions to this project after offically submitting it as I feel it would be a useful aside while contnuing the progress through the course, I can then apply new techniques and update the site to practice and use the information I have gained through the learning process. 

-------------------------------------------------

## UX

as the subject of the project is myself and my portfolio of work, my primary demographic will be potential future employers/clients but also the site will cater for users with a general interest in the content. 

I have identified 3 potential users of the site, please find their stories below.

### USER STORIES

#### POTENTIAL EMPLOYER

As a potential employer,

I would like to be able to see the candidates work history,

So that I can assess whether the candidate has the experience I am looking for

#### POTENTIAL CLIENT

As a potential client,

I would like to be able to see examples and portfolio of work

So that I can be confident of the developers skills

#### CASUAL USER

As a casual user, 

I would like to be able to navigate each page easily, 

So that I am able to the enjoy the content without worrying getting lost. 

Wireframes, or more what could be more accurately described as high resolution mock-ups, can be found in the 'Wireframes' folder within this project.
